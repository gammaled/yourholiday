 ## UX (User Experience) 
 ---
 ### Project Goals 
 Create a site that allows users to plan their holiday destinations and explore difference choices.

 ### User Goals

* Search for specific activities and tourist attractions of potential interest.
* Use it to help planning holiday where the destination has already been decided.

### User Stories 
* As a user, I want to explore different locations in the world to decide where to travel for a holiday.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the different attractions, restaurants, hotels and events available in any potential holiday destination to help me decide.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily search and find helpful information without too much hassle.
* As a user, I want to be able to get contact details and addresses of locations of interest for the sake of holiday planning. 

### Site Owner Goals

* Help users to explore a potential holiday destination and possible activities there.
* Help users navigate site without complication and difficulty, make the experiences as smooth as possible.

### User Requirements and Expectations

* Web application should be on the header part of front-page to dominate the webpage.
* Should be a one page website that has only web app on display to avoid distracting user from main feature.

* Looks professional and the colour schemes should relax user as if they were on holiday.

### Design Choices

**Fonts**

I looked for a simple and asthetically pleasing font to match typical holiday themes of relaxations and good times. I chose [Palanquin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Palanquin?category=Sans+Serif&sort=popularity&query=pa#standard-styles) for all texts and headers. 

**Colours**

I chose to use the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffb5a7-fcd5ce-f8edeb-f9dcc4-fec89a) colour scheme generator to find one suitable for this project. Below is a screenshot of the colour scheme. I have colours you would find in beaches, where many people usually take their holidays and associate with holidays. They are soft colours that are pleasant to look at and would relax the user.
